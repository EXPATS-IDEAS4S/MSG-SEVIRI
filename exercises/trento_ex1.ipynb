    "Preprocessing and outliers: make them plot the distribution of the entire month (too much?). Ask if they see outliers. For example the high peak of low reflectances, why? So the reason is due to VIS channels at nighttime not detecting anything and this is noise that needs to be discarded. Then ask them to filter out the nighttime (in an easy way, just include a reasonable threshold for daytime, considering that July is summertime). If other outliers are visible? Maybe the sunlint of the NIR is visible, so let them try to explain why. EXTRA: should I include a part about parallax correction? "
